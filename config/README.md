### Possible types used in configuration:

 - `<bool>`: a boolean value `true` or `false`
 - `<addr>`: string value consisting of a hostname or IP followed by an optional port number
 - `<scheme>`: a string that can take the values `http` or `https`
 - `<duration>`: a duration matching the regular expression `^([0-9]+)(w|d|h|m|s|ms|Âµs|ns)`
 - `<networks>`: string value consisting of IP, IP mask or named group, for example `"127.0.0.1"` or `"127.0.0.1/24"`. 
 - `<host_name>`: string value consisting of host name, for example `"example.com"`
 - `<byte_size>`: string value matching the regular expression `/^\d+(\.\d+)?[KMGTP]?B?$/i`, for example `"100MB"`

### Global configuration consist of:
```yml
# Whether to print debug logs

# Whether to ignore security warnings
hack_me_please <bool> | default = false [optional]

# Named list of cache configurations
caches:
  - <cache_config> ...

# Named network lists
network_groups: <network_groups_config> ... [optional]

server:
  <server_config> [optional]

# List of allowed users
# which requests will be proxied to ClickHouse
users:
  - <user_config> ...

clusters:
  - <cluster_config> ...
```

### <network_groups_config>
```yml

# When multiple requests with identical query simultaneously hit `chproxy`
# and there is no cached response for the query, then only a single
# request will be proxied to clickhouse. Other requests will wait
# for the cached response during this grace duration.

# from `thundering herd` problem.
