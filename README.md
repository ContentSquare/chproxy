# chproxy
Chproxy, is an http proxy and load balancer for [ClickHouse](https://ClickHouse.yandex) database. It provides the following features:

- May proxy requests to multiple distinct `ClickHouse` clusters depending on the input user. For instance, requests from `appserver` user may go to `stats-raw` cluster, while requests from `reportserver` user may go to `stats-aggregate` cluster.
- May map input users to per-cluster users. This prevents from exposing real usernames and passwords used in `ClickHouse` clusters. Additionally this allows mapping multiple distinct input users to a single `ClickHouse` user.
- May accept incoming requests via HTTP and HTTPS.
- May limit HTTP and HTTPS access by IP/IP-mask lists.
- May limit per-user access by IP/IP-mask lists.
- May limit per-user query duration. Timed out or canceled queries are forcibly killed
  via [KILL QUERY](http://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/query_language/queries.html#kill-query).
- May limit per-user requests rate.
- May limit per-user number of concurrent requests.
- All the limits may be independently set for each input user and for each per-cluster user.
- May delay request execution until it fits per-user limits.
- Per-user [response caching](#caching) may be configured.
- Response caches have built-in protection against [thundering herd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_stampede) problem aka `dogpile effect`.
- Evenly spreads requests among replicas and nodes using `least loaded` + `round robin` technique.
- Monitors node health and prevents from sending requests to unhealthy nodes.
- Supports automatic HTTPS certificate issuing and renewal via [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
- May proxy requests to each configured cluster via either HTTP or [HTTPS](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/blob/96d1ab89da451911eb54eccf1017eb5f94068a34/dbms/src/Server/config.xml#L15).
- Prepends User-Agent request header with remote/local address and in/out usernames before proxying it to `ClickHouse`, so this info may be queried from [system.query_log.http_user_agent](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/issues/847).
- Exposes various useful [metrics](#metrics) in [prometheus text format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/).
- Configuration may be updated without restart - just send `SIGHUP` signal to `chproxy` process.
- Easy to manage and run - just pass config file path to a single `chproxy` binary.
- Easy to [configure](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config/examples/simple.yml):
```yml
server:
  http:
    listen_addr: ":9090"
    allowed_networks: ["127.0.0.0/24"]

users:
  - name: "default"
    to_cluster: "default"
    to_user: "default"

# by default each cluster has `default` user which can be overridden by section `users`
clusters:
  - name: "default"
    nodes: ["127.0.0.1:8123"]

```

## How to install

### Precompiled binaries

Precompiled `chproxy` binaries are available [here](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/releases).
Just download the latest stable binary, unpack and run it with the desired [config](#configuration):

```
./chproxy -config=/path/to/config.yml
```

### Building from source

Chproxy is written in [Go](https://golang.org/). The easiest way to install it from sources is:

```
go get -u github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy
```

If you don't have Go installed on your system - follow [this guide](https://golang.org/doc/install).


## Why it was created

`ClickHouse` may exceed [max_execution_time](http://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings/query_complexity.html#max-execution-time) and [max_concurrent_queries](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/blob/add13f233eb6d30da4c75c4309542047a1dde033/dbms/src/Server/config.xml#L75) limits due to various reasons:
- `max_execution_time` may be exceeded due to the current [implementation deficiencies](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/issues/217).
- `max_concurrent_queries` works only on a per-node basis. There is no way to limit the number of concurrent queries on a cluster if queries are spread across cluster nodes.

Such "leaky" limits may lead to high resource usage on all the cluster nodes. After facing this problem we had to maintain two distinct http proxies in front of our `ClickHouse` cluster - one for spreading `INSERT`s among cluster nodes and another one for sending `SELECT`s to a dedicated node where limits may be enforced somehow. This was fragile and inconvenient to manage, so `chproxy` has been created :)


## Use cases

### Spread `INSERT`s among cluster shards

Usually `INSERT`s are sent from app servers located in a limited number of subnetworks. `INSERT`s from other subnetworks must be denied.

All the `INSERT`s may be routed to a [distributed table](http://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/table_engines/distributed.html) on a single node. But this increases resource usage (CPU and network) on the node comparing to other nodes, since it must parse each row to be inserted and route it to the corresponding node (shard).

It would be better to spread `INSERT`s among available shards and to route them directly to per-shard tables instead of distributed tables. The routing logic may be embedded either directly into applications generating `INSERT`s or may be moved to a proxy. Proxy approach is better since it allows re-configuring `ClickHouse` cluster without modification of application configs and without application downtime. Multiple identical proxies may be started on distinct servers for scalability and availability purposes.

The following minimal `chproxy` config may be used for [this use case](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config/examples/spread.inserts.yml):
```yml
server:
  http:
      listen_addr: ":9090"

      # Networks with application servers.
      allowed_networks: ["10.10.1.0/24"]

users:
  - name: "insert"
    to_cluster: "stats-raw"
    to_user: "default"

clusters:
  - name: "stats-raw"

    # Requests are spread in `round-robin` + `least-loaded` fashion among nodes.
    # Unreachable and unhealthy nodes are skipped.
    nodes: [
      "10.10.10.1:8123",
      "10.10.10.2:8123",
      "10.10.10.3:8123",
      "10.10.10.4:8123"
    ]
```

### Spread `SELECT`s from reporting apps among cluster nodes

Reporting apps usually generate various customer reports from `SELECT` query results.
The load generated by such `SELECT`s on `ClickHouse` cluster may vary depending
on the number of online customers and on the generated report types. It is obvious
that the load must be limited in order to prevent cluster overload.

All the `SELECT`s may be routed to a [distributed table](http://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/table_engines/distributed.html) on a single node. But this increases resource usage (RAM, CPU and network) on the node comparing to other nodes, since it must do final aggregation, sorting and filtering for the data obtained from cluster nodes (shards).

It would be better to create identical distributed tables on each shard and spread `SELECT`s among all the available shards.

The following minimal `chproxy` config may be used for [this use case](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config/examples/spread.selects.yml):
```yml
server:
  http:
      listen_addr: ":9090"

      # Networks with reporting servers.
      allowed_networks: ["10.10.2.0/24"]

users:
  - name: "report"
    to_cluster: "stats-aggregate"
    to_user: "readonly"
    max_concurrent_queries: 6
    max_execution_time: 1m

clusters:
  - name: "stats-aggregate"
    nodes: [
      "10.10.20.1:8123",
      "10.10.20.2:8123"
    ]
    users:
      - name: "readonly"
        password: "****"
```

### Authorize users by passwords via HTTPS

Suppose you need to access `ClickHouse` cluster from anywhere by username/password.
This may be used for building graphs from [ClickHouse-grafana](https://github.com/Vertamedia/ClickHouse-grafana) or [tabix](https://tabix.io/).
It is bad idea to transfer unencrypted password and data over untrusted networks.
So HTTPS must be used for accessing the cluster in such cases.
The following `chproxy` config may be used for [this use case](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config/examples/https.yml):
```yml
server:
  https:
    listen_addr: ":443"
    autocert:
      cache_dir: "certs_dir"

users:
  - name: "web"
    password: "****"
    to_cluster: "stats-raw"
    to_user: "web"
    max_concurrent_queries: 2
    max_execution_time: 30s
    requests_per_minute: 10
    deny_http: true

    # Allow `CORS` requests for `tabix`.
    allow_cors: true

    # Enable requests queueing - `chproxy` will queue up to `max_queue_size`
    # of incoming requests for up to `max_queue_time` until they stop exceeding
    # the current limits.
    # This allows gracefully handling request bursts when more than
    # `max_concurrent_queries` concurrent requests arrive.
    max_queue_size: 40
    max_queue_time: 25s

    # Enable response caching. See cache config below.
    cache: "shortterm"

clusters:
  - name: "stats-raw"
    nodes: [
     "10.10.10.1:8123",
     "10.10.10.2:8123",
     "10.10.10.3:8123",
     "10.10.10.4:8123"
    ]
    users:
      - name: "web"
        password: "****"

caches:
  - name: "shortterm"
    dir: "/path/to/cache/dir"
    max_size: 150Mb

    # Cached responses will expire in 130s.
    expire: 130s
```

### All the above configs combined

All the above cases may be combined in a single `chproxy` [config](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config/examples/combined.yml):

```yml

  http:
      listen_addr: ":9090"

    expire: 130s
```

## Configuration

### Server
`Chproxy` may accept requests over `HTTP` and `HTTPS` protocols. [HTTPS](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#https_config) must be configured with custom certificate or with automated [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates.

Access to `chproxy` can be limitied by list of IPs or IP masks. This option can be applied to [HTTP](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#http_config), [HTTPS](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#https_config), [metrics](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#metrics_config), [user](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#user_config) or [cluster-user](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#cluster_user_config).

### Users
There are two types of users: `in-users` (in global section) and `out-users` (in cluster section).
This means all requests will be matched to `in-users` and if all checks are Ok - will be matched to `out-users`
with overriding credentials.

Suppose we have one ClickHouse user `web` with `read-only` permissions and `max_concurrent_queries: 4` limit.
There are two distinct applications `reading` from ClickHouse. We may create two distinct `in-users` with `to_user: "web"` and `max_concurrent_queries: 2` each in order to avoid situation when a single application exhausts all the 4-request limit on the `web` user.

Requests to `chproxy` must be authorized with credentials from [user_config](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#user_config). Credentials can be passed via [BasicAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) or via `user` and `password` [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) args.

Limits for `in-users` and `out-users` are independent.

### Clusters
`Chproxy` can be configured with multiple `cluster`s. Each `cluster` must have a name and either a list of nodes
or a list of replicas with nodes. See [cluster-config](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/tree/master/config#cluster_config) for details.
Requests to each cluster are balanced among replicas and nodes using `round-robin` + `least-loaded` approach.
The node priority is automatically decreased for a short interval if recent requests to it were unsuccessful.
This means that the `chproxy` will choose the next least loaded healthy node among least loaded replica
for every new request.

Additionally each node is periodically checked for availability. Unavailable nodes are automatically excluded from the cluster until they become available again. This allows performing node maintenance without removing unavailable nodes from the cluster config.

`Chproxy` automatically kills queries exceeding `max_execution_time` limit. By default `chproxy` tries to kill such queries
under `default` user. The user may be overriden with [kill_query_user](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#kill_query_user_config).

If `cluster`'s [users](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#cluster_user_config) section isn't specified, then `default` user is used with no limits.

### Caching

`Chproxy` may be configured to cache responses. It is possible to create multiple
[cache-configs](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config/#cache_config) with various settings.
Response caching is enabled by assigning cache name to user. Multiple users may share the same cache.
Currently only `SELECT` responses are cached.
Caching is disabled for request with `no_cache=1` in query string.
Optional cache namespace may be passed in query string as `cache_namespace=aaaa`. This allows caching
distinct responses for the identical query under distinct cache namespaces. Additionally,
an instant cache flush may be built on top of cache namespaces - just switch to new namespace in order
to flush the cache.

### Security
`Chproxy` removes all the query params from input requests (except the user's [params](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#param_groups_config) and listed [here](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/scope.go#L292))
before proxying them to `ClickHouse` nodes. This prevents from unsafe overriding
of various `ClickHouse` [settings](http://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interfaces/http_interface.html).

Be careful when configuring limits, allowed networks, passwords etc.
By default `chproxy` tries detecting the most obvious configuration errors such as `allowed_networks: ["0.0.0.0/0"]` or sending passwords via unencrypted HTTP.

Special option `hack_me_please: true` may be used for disabling all the security-related checks during config validation (if you are feeling lucky :) ).

#### Example of [full](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config/testdata/full.yml) configuration:

## FAQ

* *Is `chproxy` production ready?*

  Yes, we successfully use it in production for both `INSERT` and `SELECT`
  requests.

* *What about `chproxy` performance?*

  A single `chproxy` instance easily proxies 1Gbps of compressed `INSERT` data
  while using less than 20% of a single CPU core in our production setup.

* *Does `chproxy` support [native interface](http://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interfaces/tcp.html) for ClickHouse?*

  No. Because currently all our services work with ClickHouse only via HTTP.
  Support for `native interface` may be added in the future.
