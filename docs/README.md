# Chproxy documentation

The documentation website is build with Nuxt and the official docs theme.

It is automatically deployed on each commit on the `main` branch, through
Render.

## TODO:

- Update the README with links
- Configure Render for deployment 
- Configure Render for Pull Requests
  - Can we make it smart and only re-render if changes in the docs, not if
    changes in the code?
- Configure chproxy.org
- Configure Algolia DocSearch
- Need to add a logo
